## 📊 Understanding Learning Curves

Learning curves can help you understand how your model improves as you provide more data. They illustrate the performance of your model on training data and testing data. In this project, you'll see plots that show:

- **Training Error**: How well the model performs on the training set.
- **Validation Error**: How accurately the model generalizes to new data.

These plots enable you to assess whether your model is underfitting or overfitting.

## 📚 Topics Covered

This project includes several important topics in machine learning, including:

- California Housing dataset
- Linear regression
- Data visualization with matplotlib
- Model evaluation with train-test split
